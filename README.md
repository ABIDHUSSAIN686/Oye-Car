# Oye-Car
Project Introduction:
•	Nature of the project:
The Project is a Web application that helps in the online buying/selling of vehicles.
•	Scope:
For most people, a vehicle is a very important purchase decision and with modern lifestyles, it has become a necessity. 
In some places, it is not possible to view a car at the showroom before purchase due to the non-availability of showroom 
cars or delays in production, and the main problem after buying a car is its availability of auto parts. The proposed 
vehicle showroom management system is very effective. If anyone is interested in buying and selling a car, then they 
can check all the information related to the vehicle. Users will be able to see pictures of each trim level of the vehicle,
and the system will help the buyer to check which vehicle is good for them by giving them a test drive, and by showing them 
reviews/articles about the vehicle. After choosing the desired vehicle, the vehicle will be dispatched from the closest branch 
to avoid delay. The System also provides a wide range of services such as maintenance, verification, inspection, repairing, 
insurance to give the best experience to the customer.
